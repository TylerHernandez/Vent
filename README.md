# Vent

This app uses Google Cloud, WebApp2, DataStore and Twillio.


This app is aimed at providing help for people with mental health disorders without them having to give up their identities.
Often, people are stigmatized for having mental health problems, and our app creates a safe space 
for people like this to receive the help they need.

When a user logs on to the website, they click "need help", fill out a short description of the kind of help they need,
for example depression, anxiety etc, and they are redirected to a page with a list of Twillio numbers they can contact for help. 

They can text "start" to the number, and using the Twillio service, they receive responses based on their 
text messages and the kind of help they need.
They then get paired with a doctor who already signed up on the site to offer their services
